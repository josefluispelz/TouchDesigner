# Runge Kutter Method for particle systems in TOPs

This TOX allows you to write very simple GLSL code to handle force fields in TOPs.
You can set both spacial and ageing limits for particles, just like in the particle SOP. 

The TOX is supposed to be used in a feedback loop as shown in the demo files.
